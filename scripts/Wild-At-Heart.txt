And now the story of Sailor and Lula.....




1. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

A MAN rides a screaming massive Japanese motorcycle - wound out to 
maximum R.P.M. up the street.

								CUT TO:


2. SIGN BY ROADSIDE

The sign reads ÂKIDS PLAYING - SPEED BUMPSÂ.

								CUT TO:


3. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed 
bump.

The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half 
as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab.

In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by.

The motorcycle bounces off a black Â66 Chevrolet and makes a sound like 
the end of the world.

The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later.  Like a broken ragdoll 
shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass 
for a block.  He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of 
blood forms out his nose.

The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing 
howl for one entire city block.

								CUT TO:


4. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - VACANT LOT - DAY

Two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each otherÂs 
flesh.  An OLD COUPLE, both with walkers, inch painfully along nearby.

				OLD WOMAN
		Oh my God! ... Why they doinÂ that?

				OLD MAN
		Who the hell knows.  What you have
		in your mouth?

The old woman begins to turn away, covering her mouth with her hand.

				OLD MAN 
		Spit it out!!! ... Pull your teeth
		out ... doctor said.  What you 
		tryinÂ to do?  SPIT IT OUT!!!

The Old Man grabs the Old Woman by the neck and squeezes.  Out comes a 
tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies.

								CUT TO:


5. WASP NEST

A thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest.  A 
SMALL GROUP OF HARDENED CRIMINAL NINE-YEAR OLDS sporting hideous grins, 
bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks.  One kid busies himself 
shooting a large can of Black Flag garden spray into a crack in the 
nest.  Another stomps half-dead wasps up and down the sidewalk.  All the 
kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other.

								CUT TO:


6. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

The telephone rings.  MARIETTA PACE FORTUNE, a rich Southern woman 
around fifty, carries her Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth drink across 
the livingroom and answers the phone.

				MARIETTA
		Hello...  Who is this?...

								CUT TO:


7. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

A GUARD stands by as SAILOR RIPLEY, twenty-three years old - lost 
somewhere between the cool long-gone generation and a used-car salesman 
- speaks on a prisoner phone in a green cement cubicle with one bench.

				SAILOR
			(into phone)
		...Sailor Ripley...  Can I talk 
		to Lula?

								CUT TO:


6A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

				MARIETTA
		ThereÂs no way in hell you can speak
		to her and...

								CUT TO:


7A. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

				SAILOR
			(feeling a smile coming on)
		What?...

								CUT TO:


6B. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

				MARIETTA
		...Yes you heard me...  DonÂt ever 
		call back here again.

Marietta hangs up the phone as LULA PACE FORTUNE, MariettaÂs twenty-year 
old daughter, comes quickly down the stairs.

				LULA
		Mama???

				MARIETTA
		You know who it was and you know 
		you arenÂt, and I mean ARE NOT 
		gonna see him EVER...  End of story.

				LULA
			(quietly)
		Like hell.

Marietta, her hand still on the telephone, grips the receiver so hard 
her knuckles turn white.

								CUT TO:


8. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LULAÂS ROOM UPSTAIRS - DAY

Lula enters her room and cranks up her stereo.  Speed metal music jumps 
up to around one hundred twenty decibels.

								CUT TO:


9. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

The guard escorts Sailor away from the telephone and back to his cell.  
The iron bars of the door slide across SailorÂs face and close with a 
bang.

								CUT TO:


10. EXT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT

A beat-up, red Â64 Ford Falcon station wagon filled with insane 
TEENAGERS on speed and PCP race out of control down the street past the 
club - leaning out the car in every direction.  They scream out to the 
desolate-looking passerby.

				TEENAGERS
		EAT SHIT MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!

The camera cranes up to the neon club sign and gets lost among the hot 
pink neon, the frantic moths and the intense electric buzz.

								CUT TO:


11. INT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT

Lula and her friend, BEANY THORN, sit at a table drinking rum Coca-Colas 
while watching and listening to a white blues band called THE BLEACH 
BOYS.  The group segues smoothly from Elmore JamesÂs ÂDust my BroomÂ 
into Robert JohnsonÂs ÂMe and the DevilÂ and Beany lets out a snort.

				BEANY
		I can dig this music...  But not 
		that singer.

				LULA
		Why?...  HeÂs right in the groove.

				BEANY
		HeÂs so ugly.  Guys with beards and
		beer guts ainÂt quite my type.

				LULA
		          (giggles)
		SeeinÂs how youÂre about as thick as
		a used string of unwaxed dental floss,
		donÂt know how you can criticize.

				BEANY
		Yeah, well, if he says that all that
		flab turns into dick at midnight, 
		heÂs a liar.

Lula and Beany laugh and swallow some of their drinks.

				BEANY
		So, SailorÂs gettinÂ out soon, and
		youÂre gonna see him?

Lula nods and crushes an ice cube with her back teeth and chews it.

				LULA
		MeetinÂ him at the gate.  That phone
		call this afternoon was the signal.
		My deranged mamaÂs hid the keys to
		my car.  But of course, I know 
		exactly where they are.

				BEANY
		I didnÂt hate me so much, IÂd feel
		better wishinÂ you luck.

				LULA
		CanÂt all husbands be perfect, and
		your Elmo probÂly wouldnÂta ever 
		got that second one pregnant, you
		hadnÂt kicked his ass out.

				BEANY
		So youÂre gonna be needinÂ the 
		Âblue-birdÂ pretty soon?

				LULA
		Real soon ... IÂll be makinÂ the swap 
		tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.

The Bleach Boys kick into some kind of Professor Longhair swamp mambo.

								CUT TO:


12. EXT. BAY ST. CLEMENT - DAY

Plumes of smoke from fires rise in the distance.

DISSOLVE TO:


13. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

An empty livingroom.  The smoke from the city fire appears during the 
course of the DISSOLVE to be in the livingroom - then it disappears.

An empty hallway.

An empty stairway.


13A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - MARIETTAÂS BEDROOM - DAY

Feet (LulaÂs) was across carpet.

A closet door opens.

A hand (LulaÂs) reaches into the pocket of a coat in her motherÂs 
closet.  The hand comes out clutching car keys.


13B. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - STAIRWAY - DAY

Lula races down the stairs and through a door into the garage.

								CUT TO:

The electronic garage door opens and Lula drives her Â80 Black Camaro 
out and away.  The garage door closes automatically.

								CUT TO:


15. EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

Lula drives fast up a neighborhood street.  She turns a corner and 
disappears.

								CUT TO:


16. INT. BEANY THORNÂS GARAGE - DAY

Lula throws her car keys under the front seat and goes around to BeanyÂs 
Â67 dark blue Thunderbird convertible - fishes around under the T-BirdÂs 
front seat for the keys - finds them - jumps in and takes off.

DISSOLVE TO:


17. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

Marietta leaves her Cadillac Seville in her driveway and enters the 
house.  We can hear her calling out for Lula in the distance.  The 
calling changes - it becomes angry.  The garage door opens and Marietta 
comes storming out.  She leaps in her Caddy and peels out.

								CUT TO:


18. INT. ÂSOUTHERN TIMEÂ BAR - DAY

Marietta enters the bar on the run.  She calls out to the BARTENDER...

				MARIETTA
		WhereÂs Johnnie?  HeÂs not in his office.

				BARTENDER
		HavenÂt seen Âim yet today, Marietta.

				MARIETTA
			(slightly hysterical)
		Well I gotta find him - right this
		minute!

								CUT TO:


19. EXT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

Sailor is waiting out front as Lula pulls up in her T-Bird - throwing 
out a cloud of dust.  TheyÂre both smiling.

				LULA
		Hey baby...

				SAILOR
		Peanut...

They kiss tenderly and then Sailor walks around the car to get in while 
Lula opens up a suitcase and gets out his snakeskin jacket.

				SAILOR
		Hey, my snakeskin jacket...  Thanks,    
		baby...  Did I ever tell you that
		this here jacket for me is a symbol
		of my individuality and my belief
		in personal freedom?

				LULA
		ÂBout fifty thousand times.  I got 
		us a room at the Cape Fear, and 
		guess what?...  I hear PowermadÂs 
		at ÂThe Hurricane.Â

				SAILOR
			(smiling)
		Stab it and steer.

Lula tromps it and throws out an even larger cloud of dust.

								CUT TO:


20. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Sailor and Lula lay on the bed in the Cape Fear Hotel listening to the 
fan creak.

				LULA
		Did you ever think somethinÂ like
		about the wicked witch of the east
		cominÂ flyinÂ in?...  Did you ever
		think somethinÂ and then later think
		youÂve said it out loud to someone?

				SAILOR
		I really did miss your mind while I
		was out at Pee Dee, honey.  The
		rest of you, too, of course.  But 
		the way your head works is GodÂs own
		private mystery.  What was it you
		was thinkinÂ?

				LULA
		Well, I was thinkinÂ about smokinÂ 
		actually...  My mama smokes Marlboros
		now, used to be she smoked Kools?
		I stole Âem from her beginninÂ in
		about sixth grade.  When I got old
		enough to buy my own, I bought those.
		Now IÂve just about settled on Mores,
		as you probably noticed?  TheyÂre longer.


				SAILOR
		I guess I started smokinÂ when I was
		about six...  My mama was already
		dead from lung cancer...

				LULA
		What brandÂd she smoke?

				SAILOR
		Camels, same as me...  Guess both
		my mama and my daddy died of smoke
		or alcohol related illness.

				LULA
		Gee, Sailor.  IÂm sorry, honey.  I 
		never would have guessed it.

				SAILOR
		ItÂs okay.  I hardly used to see 
		them anyway.  I didnÂt have much 
		parental guiding.  The public defender
		kept sayinÂ that at my parole hearinÂ.
		He was a good olÂ boy, stood by me...
		Even brought me some cartons of 
		cigarettes from time to time.

				LULA
		IÂd stand by you, Sailor ... through
		anything.

				SAILOR
		Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after
		I planted Bob Ray Lemon.  A man canÂt
		ask for more than that.

Lula pulls Sailor over to her and kisses him soft on the mouth.

				LULA
		You move me, Sailor, you really do.
		You mark me the deepest.

Sailor pulls down the sheet, exposing LulaÂs breasts.

				SAILOR
		YouÂre perfect for me, too.

				LULA
		You remind me of my daddy, you know?
		Mama told me he liked skinny women
		whose breasts were just a bit too
		big for their bodies.  He had a long
		nose, too, like theirs.  Did I ever
		tell you how he died?

				SAILOR
		In a fire, as I recall.

				LULA
		Started he couldnÂt remember things?
		Got real violent?  Mama kept tellinÂ
		me it was on account of lead poisoning
		from cleaninÂ the old paint off our
		house without usinÂ a mask...  But
		I donÂt know.  Seems like his brain
		just fell apart in pieces.

								CUT TO:


21. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

CLYDE FORTUNE tears a door off the kitchen cabinets and strews the 
cabinet contents all across the counter and floor.  He puts his fist 
through the kitchen window.  He leaps on the counter and bats the 
kitchen ceiling light - smashing it.  He kicks over the refrigerator.

				CLYDE
		FUCKINÂ BITCH!!!!

								CUT TO:


22. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

LulaÂs eyes look off, remembering.

				LULA
		Finally in the middle of the one 
		night, with me and mama asleep 
		upstairs ... he poured kerosene over
		himself and lit a match.

								CUT TO:


23. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

Clyde Fortune, completely engulfed in fire, races across and back the 
livingroom until he collapses in a fifties modern armchair.  The drapes 
behind him burst in flames.

				LULA
			(voice-over)
		Near burned down the house.  We 
		got out just in time.

The whole livingroom goes up in flames.

								CUT TO:


24. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

CU the red hot ash of LulaÂs cigarette as she inhales deeply.  As she 
exhales a cloud of smoke she turns to Sailor.

				LULA
		It was a year before I met you.

Sailor takes the cigarette out of LulaÂs hand and puts it into the 
ashtray by her bed.  He pulls her to him and kisses her throat.

				SAILOR
		You have such a pretty, long neck, 
		like a swan.

				LULA
		Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth
		white neck.  It was like on a 
		statue it was so white?

Sailor drifts his thumb over LulaÂs left nipple then cups her breast in 
his hand.  They kiss.

								CUT TO:


25. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

Marietta pours JOHNNIE FARRAGUT another shot of scotch.

				MARIETTA
		I knew this would happen.  Soon as
		that piece of filth got out of 
		Pee Dee, I knew thereÂd be trouble.
		HeÂs just got some kind of influence
		over her I canÂt decipher.  ThereÂs 
		somethinÂ wild in Lula I donÂt know
		where it comes from.  You gotta find
		Âem, Johnnie.

				JOHNNIE
		He served his time for what he did.
		Another thing...  If Lula went with
		him of her own volition - willingly,
		that is - there ainÂt much can be
		done about it.

				MARIETTA
		DonÂt talk down to me, Johnnie 
		Farragut.  I know what volition means,
		and thatÂs why I want Sailor Ripley
		off the planet!  HeÂs pure slime and 
		itÂs leakinÂ all over my baby.  
		Maybe you could push him into makinÂ
		some kinda move and then kill him
		dead.  YouÂd only be defendinÂ 
		yourself, and with his record, 
		nobodyÂd fuss.

Johnnie pours himself another tumblerful of Walker Black Label.

				JOHNNIE
		IÂll locate Lula, Marietta, and if
		sheÂs with the Ripley boy, IÂll
		give him a talkinÂ to and try to
		convince her to come back with me.
		ThatÂs about all I can do.

He takes a long swallow from the tumbler.  Marietta begins to cry.  She 
blubbers for a few seconds, and then stops as abruptly as sheÂd started.  
Her grey eyes glaze over.

				MARIETTA
		IÂll hire a hit man if you donÂt want
		to help me stop this thing.  IÂll
		call Marcello Santos.

				JOHNNIE
		Now, Marietta, I am goinÂ to help you.
		And donÂt be gettinÂ carried away.
		You donÂt want to be bringinÂ Santos
		and his people into it.

				MARIETTA
		YouÂre just jealous of Santos cause
		heÂs sweet on me.

				JOHNNIE
		DarlinÂ, you ainÂt seeinÂ Santos 
		again, are ya?

				MARIETTA
		Oh, Johnnie Farragut...  DonÂt you 
		trust your very own Marietta?

				JOHNNIE
		Sorry, sweetheart.  BeinÂ in love 
		with you like I am brings out that 
		ugly jealous side.

				MARIETTA
		Well stop worryinÂ about me and 
		start worryinÂ about how youÂre 
		gonna get that Lula back here and 
		away from that murderer.

				JOHNNIE
		Sailor ainÂt a murderer.  You got to
		get off that kick.  And farÂs I can 
		tell, Sailor was entire clean prior
		to that involvinÂ Lula.  Even there
		he was protectinÂ her.  You oughta
		be thankinÂ him for that.  That Bob
		Ray Lemon they say was cominÂ after
		the both of Âem.  Why am I tellinÂ
		you this, you was around that night.
		You ought to know just exactly what
		happened.  Sailor just got a little
		too forceful is all...  You remember
		that night...

CU of MariettaÂ eyes as she thinks back.

								CUT TO:


26. INT. BAY ST. CLEMENT HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

We see Marietta standing in a carpeted hallway above the ballroom.  
Dance band music can be heard in the distance.  Sailor appears coming up 
the hallway - slightly drunk - he carefully sets his drink on the carpet 
outside the MENÂS ROOM.

MariettaÂs POV of Sailor entering the MENÂS ROOM.

CU of MariettaÂs glazed eyes and smiling face.

MariettaÂs POV of walking toward MENÂS ROOM.

								CUT TO:


27. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

				MARIETTA
		Maybe I was there, but I didnÂt see 
		anythinÂ.  All I knowÂs that trash
		killed a man with his bare hands.
		Hands which are now probÂly all
		over my baby!

				JOHNNIE
		Marietta, settle down now darlinÂ...
		I want whatÂs best for her, too -
		Like I said, IÂll do what I can to
		bring her home.

								CUT TO:


28. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Lula is standing in the bathroom of their room at the Hotel fooling with 
her hair in front of the mirror.  Sailor can see her through the doorway 
from where he lays on the bed.

				LULA
		Sailor, you are somethinÂ else, 
		honey...  When I was fifteen, Mama
		told me that pretty soon IÂd be
		startinÂ to think about sex, and
		I should talk to her before I did
		anything about it.

				SAILOR
		But honey, I thought you told me
		your Uncle Pooch raped you when
		you was thirteen.

				LULA
		ThatÂs true.  Uncle Pooch wasnÂt
		really an uncle.  He was a business
		partner of my daddyÂs?  And my mama
		never knew nothinÂ about me and 
		him - thatÂs for damn sure.  His real
		name was somethinÂ kind of European,
		like Pucinski.  But everyone just
		called him Pooch.  He came around the
		house sometimes when Daddy was away.
		I always figured he was sweet on 
		mama, so when he cornered me one 
		afternoon, I was surprised moreÂn
		a little.

				SAILOR
		HowÂd it happen, peanut?  He just
		pull out the old toad and let it
		croak?

Lula brushes away her bangs and frowns.  She takes a cigarette from the 
pack on the sink and lights it, then lets it dangle from her lips while 
she teases her hair.

				LULA
		YouÂre terrible crude sometimes, 
		Sailor, you know?

				SAILOR
		I canÂt hardly understand you when
		you talk with one of them Mores in
		your mouth.

Lula takes a long, slow drag on her More and sets it down on the edge of 
the sink.

				LULA
		I said you can be too crude sometimes?
		I donÂt think I care for it.

				SAILOR
		Sorry, sugar.  Go on and tell me how
		old Pooch done the deed.

				LULA
		Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havinÂ
		her hair dyed?  And I was alone in 
		the house.

								CUT TO:


29. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

We see what she talks about.

				LULA
			(voice-over)
		Uncle Pooch came in the side door
		through the porch, you know?  Where
		I was makinÂ a jelly and banana
		sandwich?  I remember I had my hair
		in curlers cause I was goinÂ that
		night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the
		DeSoto sisters.  Uncle Pooch must have
		known nobody but me was home, cause 
		he came right in and put both his
		hands on my butt and sorta shoved me
		up against the counter.

								CUT TO:


30. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

				SAILOR
		DidnÂt he say somethinÂ?

Lula shakes her head.  She picks up her cigarette, takes a puff and 
throws it into the toilet.

ECU of cigarette in toilet.

				LULA
		Not really.  Least not so I recall now.

Lula flushes the toilet and watches the More come apart as it swirls 
down the hole.

ECU of cigarette coming apart as it swirls.

				SAILOR
		So howÂd he finally nail you?  Right 
		there in the kitchen?  

				LULA
		No, he picked me up.

								CUT TO:


31. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN/MAIDÂS ROOM - DAY

We see what she talks about.

				LULA
			(voice-over)
		He was short but powerful.  With 
		hairy arms?  Anyway, he carried me 
		into the maidÂs dayroom which nobody
		used.  We did it there on an old bed.

								CUT TO:


32. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

				SAILOR
		ÂWeÂ did it?  Whattaya mean?  DidnÂt
		he force you?

				LULA
		Well, sure.  But he was super-gentle,
		you know?  I mean, he raped me and
		all, but I guess thereÂs all 
		different kinds of rapes.  I didnÂt
		exactly want him to do it but I 
		suppose once it started, it didnÂt
		seem all that terrible.  It was over 
		pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch
		just stood there and pulled up his
		trousers and left me there.  I 
		stayed in bed till I heard him drive
		off.  Then I just went back into
		the kitchen and finished makinÂ my
		sandwich.

				SAILOR
		And you never told nobody about it?

				LULA
		Just you.  Uncle Pooch never acted
		strange or different after.  And he
		never did anything else to me.  I
		always got a nice present from him
		at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
			(pause)

								CUT TO:


33. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a Â54 Ford Pick-Up 
and a Â64 Chevy Station Wagon.  No survivors.  Balls of flame and 
grinding metal.

								CUT TO:


34. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

				LULA
		Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three
		years later while he was holidayinÂ
		in Myrtle Beach.  They still got way
		too much traffic there for my taste...
		And another thing, baby...  That
		government of ours should be keepinÂ
		us separated from outer space...

				SAILOR
		Here she goes again...

				LULA
		Sailor, that ozone layer is
		disappearinÂ.  Seems to me the 
		government could do somethinÂ about
		it.  One of these mornings the
		sunÂll come up and burn a hole clean
		through the planet like an X-Ray.

Lula strikes a match and lights another cigarette.

				SAILOR
			(laughs)
		That ainÂt never will happen, honey.
		Least not in our lifetime.

Somewhere in the hotel a woman laughs.  It is a kind of wild, crazy 
laugh, and for the few seconds it lasts, LulaÂs face goes pale.

				SAILOR
		You okay, honey?

				LULA
		That womanÂs laugh creeps me out.
		I heard somethinÂ like that...
		somewhere before...  SoundÂd like 
		the wicked witch...

				SAILOR
		Just sounded like an old gal havinÂ
		a good time to me...  You ready to
		dance?

				LULA
		IÂm always ready to dance.  But I
		need me a kiss first, honey.  Just one?

Lula and Sailor kiss.  In the middle of the kiss, the womanÂs 
creepy/crazy laugh is heard again in the distance and LulaÂs eyes snap 
open with a kind of fear.

								CUT TO:


35. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Marietta is escorting MARCELLO SANTOS and two stiff drinks to a table in 
her backyard.

				SANTOS
		I knew youÂd want it again...

				MARIETTA
		ThatÂs not why I called.

				SANTOS
		Oh yeah - sure ... okay.

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  It isnÂt.

				SANTOS
		Have it your way...  But you want it.

				MARIETTA
		LulaÂs gone off with Sailor.

				SANTOS
		What do you want me to do about it?

				MARIETTA
		I want you to take care of Sailor, so
		he wonÂt ever be able to bother my
		baby again.


				SANTOS
		Take care of him?

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		What does take care of him mean?...
		Do you want me to give him food or
		some clothing?

				MARIETTA
		WhatÂs with you?...  You know what
		take care of him means.  I donÂt 
		call Santos except for one big reason.

				SANTOS
		Big is the key word, and IÂm telling
		you I want it bad.

				MARIETTA
		I want you to get rid of Sailor.

				SANTOS
		Get rid of him?

				MARIETTA
		Yes...  Get rid of him.

				SANTOS
		How would I do that?  Send him on a
		trip - like maybe to Hawaii?

				MARIETTA
		Santos, why in hell do you insist on
		playinÂ this stupid game?

				SANTOS
		Just tell me what you want.

				MARIETTA
		I donÂt need to explain anymoreÂn I
		have...  You know damn well.

				SANTOS
		You need to explain it.

				MARIETTA
		All right...  I want you ... to ...
		kill ... Sailor...  As simple as that.

				SANTOS
		Simple?  Kill him?...  How?

				MARIETTA
		ThatÂs your business...  I donÂt care
		how.

				SANTOS
		Like an accident where maybe Lula
		might also get hurt?

				MARIETTA
		NO...  For GodÂs sakes, Santos!

				SANTOS
		Well, like kill him with the atomic
		bomb?

				MARIETTA
		Santos...

				SANTOS
		Explain it...  I told you.

				MARIETTA
		Shoot him.

				SANTOS
		Shoot him?  Like with a gun?

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		Where?...  In the leg?

				MARIETTA
		No.

				SANTOS
		Where?

				MARIETTA
		In the head.

				SANTOS
		Shoot Sailor in the head with a 
		gun...  Now IÂm beginning to get 
		it...  You want me to shoot Sailor
		in the head with a gun.

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		But where in the head?...  Not the
		chin, I hope.

				MARIETTA
		No...  In the brains...  What little

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		Wrong!  ItÂs much better to blow a

		...  Lots and lots of irreparable
		damage.

				MARIETTA
		See!  I knew you had it all under

		Why didnÂt you send Johnnie Farragut?

				MARIETTA
		Maybe I did...  Try New Orleans first...
		Lula canÂt ever stop talkinÂ Âbout that

				SANTOS
		On one condition...

He pauses and smiles strangely.

				SANTOS
		You give me your permission to kill

		No...  But...

		One day heÂs gonna find out what

		Shhhh...  ItÂs all right...  Also, I

Marietta puts her shoulders back and Santos comes and stands in front of 
her.

				SANTOS
		You got nice tits.

36. INT. ÂTHE HURRICANEÂ - A SPEED METAL CLUB - NIGHT

We see the sign which has all the letters tipped way over to the right - 
as if in a hurricane.  Two leaning palm trees border the sign.

One hundred decibels of speed metal.  We see the name ÂPowermadÂ on the 
bass drum.

The BAND segues into ÂSlaughter HouseÂ and itÂs a hot one.  Sailor grabs 
Lula and they start dancing like two jacked-up spastics in an electrical 
storm.  a few PUNKS actually stop dancing to watch Sailor and Lula.  
They thought theyÂd seen everything.

CU of Lula and Sailor - theyÂre in love and dancing hot.  An IDIOT PUNK 
moves close to Lula and rubs up against her as he dances by.  Sailor 
turns to the lead guitar player and signals him to stop the music 
immediately.  Suddenly everything is deathly quiet.  Sailor gives the 
man a fully extended ÂReno pointÂ...

				SAILOR
		Are you going to provide me with an 
		opportunity to prove my love to my
		girl?  Or are you gonna save 
		youself some trouble and step up 
		like a gentleman and apologize to her?

				IDIOT PUNK
		DonÂt fuck with me, man.  You look 
		like a clown in that stupid jacket.

				SAILOR
		This is a snakeskin jacket, and for
		me itÂs a symbol of my individuality
		and my belief in personal freedom.

				IDIOT PUNK
		...Asshole.

				SAILOR

		Come here.

				LULA
		Sailor, honey...

The Idiot Punk tries to hit Sailor, but Sailor slaps him so hard his 
knees almost bend backwards.  The Idiot Punk goes down - fighting back 
tears and holding his cheek.

				SAILOR

		IÂm sorry to do this to ya here

				IDIOT PUNK

Lula slides her head up and kisses Sailor on the cheek.

		Yeah, itÂs a real problem for me,

		Heard on the radio how doctors is

				LULA

		I got one on me at Lake Lanier.

Sailor laughs.

74. INT. MINI-MART - DAY

A tall OLD BLACK MAN about seventy years old, wearing a torn green 
Tulane tee-shirt and a dirty orange Saints baseball cap, is filing items 
on the counter by the cash register.  In the pile are four ready-made, 
plastic-wrapped sandwiches, two tuna salad and two cotto salami; six 
Twinkies; a package of Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies; four Slice 
colas; two BarqÂs root beers; and a large package of fried pork rinds, 
extra salted.

				BLACK MAN
		    (to Sailor and another guy 
		    also waiting to pay for gas)
		Sorry, gentlemen.  IÂm Âmost finished
		on my shoppinÂ here.

				ERV
		This be it?

				BLACK MAN
		YÂall take American Express?

				ERV
		Yessir.

				BLACK MAN
		Then lemme throw in a couple more
		things.

Sailor and the man in line behind him watch as the black man gathers up 
several more packages of Twinkies along with a few cupcakes and half a 
dozen cans of Pretty Kitty cat food, three liver and three chicken 
dinner portions, and tosses them on his pile.

				BLACK MAN
		   (to Sailor, smiling - showing 
		    no visible upper teeth)
		Pussycats gotta eat, too.

He hands an American Express card to the clerk, ERV, who runs it through 
the verifier.  The card checks out okay and the old guy prepares a 
charge slip, has the man sign it, and bags the purchases.

				BLACK MAN
			(to Erv)
		IÂd just soon have a paper bag 
		rather than a plastic one, if itÂs
		same to you.

				ERV
		  (shoving the plastic bag he
		   filled towards the black man)
		We donÂt have no paper bags.

A telephone begins to ring and everyone looks around.  The Black Man 
reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out a portable phone and punches 
Âsend.Â

				BLACK MAN
			(into phone)
		Hello...  Yeah, mama, IÂm on my 
		way...
			(to Sailor and other guy
		   as he picks up his bag
			and heads out)
		Thanks for waitinÂ, gentlemen.

Everyone is silent as they watch the old Black Man hobble out.

				SAILOR
			(to Erv)
		All I wantÂs ten bucks regular.
		Oh yeah, and a Mounds bar.

Erv takes one off the candy and gum rack next to the register and lays 
it on the counter.  Sailor gives him a twenty dollar bill.

				SAILOR
		I ainÂt got my American Express card
		with me, so I gotta use cash.  Hope
		thatÂs okay.

Sailor smiles, but the clerk keeps a poker face and just gives him his 
change.  The guy in line behind Sailor shakes his head and grins.


75. EXT. MINI MART/THUNDERBIRD - DAY

Sailor goes back to the car.

				LULA
		That took long enough.  You forget

Sailor tosses her the candy bar.

man, DROP SHADOW approach with their trays of food.

				REGGIE
		Do you mind if we share this table?
		...  The others, they are occupied.

Johnnie looks around - sees that there are quite a few empty tables - he 
looks the men over quickly.

				JOHNNIE
			(cautiously)
		Alright...  By all means.  Make 
		yourselves at home.

				DROP SHADOW
			(as he sits down)
		Muchas gracias.

				REGGIE
		My name is Reginald San Pedro Sula.
		But please do call me Reggie.  This
		is my friend, who we call Drop
		Shadow.  He is always with me.

Johnnie wipes off his right hand on his napkin and shakes.

				JOHNNIE
		Johnnie Farragut.  Pleased to meet ya.

Reggie and Drop Shadow begin eating ferociously, finishing half of their 
meal before saying anything more.

				REGGIE
		You are from New Orleans, Senor 
		Farragut?

				JOHNNIE
		Johnnie, please.  Nope.  Charlotte,
		North Carolina.  Here on business.

Reggie smiles broadly, revealing numerous tall, gold teeth.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.

				REGGIE
		Do you know Honduras, Johnny?

				JOHNNIE
		Only that itÂs supposed to be a 
		pretty poor sight since the hurricane
		came through last year.

				REGGIE
		Yes, thatÂs so.  But there is not 
		much to destroy.

				DROP SHADOW
		No big buildings like in New Orleans.

				JOHNNIE
		Whattaya do there?

				REGGIE
			(laughs)
		Oh, many things...

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro SulaÂs got an appliance

				REGGIE
		But I am also with the government.

Johnnie takes a bite of his oyster sandwich.

				JOHNNIE
		In what capacity?

				REGGIE
		In many capacities.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sula is with the 
		Secret Service.

Reggie reaches into his back pocket and takes out his wallet.  He hands 
a card to Johnnie.

				JOHNNIE
			(reading aloud)
		General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez.
		Telefono 666.

				REGGIE
		He is my sponsor.  The General is
		the head of the secret police of
		Honduras.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sula is one of his

Johnnie hands the card back to Reggie and Reggie gives him a small piece 
of paper, folded once.  Johnnie unfolds it.  The printing is in Spanish.

				REGGIE
		That is my permiso.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro SulaÂs permit to kill.

				REGGIE
		Only if necessary, of course, and
		only in my own country.
			(laughs)

				JOHNNIE
		Of course.

Johnnie refolds the piece of paper and hands it over to Reggie.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro SulaÂs authorized to
		carry a .45.

				REGGIE
		United States Marine issue, before
		they made the unfortunate switch to
		the less dependable nine millimeters.
		I have it here, in my briefcase.

Reggie holds up his stainless steel briefcase and then replaces it on 
the floor beneath his chair.

				JOHNNIE
		Why are you in New Orleans?  If you 
		donÂt mind my askinÂ.

				REGGIE
		Certainly not.  We are here only
		briefly, in fact, until this evening,
		when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit
		a friend of mine who is an agent for
		the CIA.

				DROP SHADOW
		He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula

				REGGIE
		We are in the same businesses and
		also we are fishermen.

Johnnie swallows the last of his beer and stands up to leave.

				JOHNNIE
			(extending his hand)
		ItÂs been a real pleasure.  I wish
		you both buena suerte wherever you go.

Reggie and Drop Shadow stand up.  They shake JohnnieÂs hand.

				REGGIE
		The same to you.  If you are in 
		Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and
		visit us.  The Hondurans are great
		friends of the American people.  But
		I have a joke for you before I go.
		If a liberal, a socialist, and a 
		communist all jumped off the roof of
		the Empire State Building at the

		hit the ground first?

		Was in all the papers three years ago.

		who wanted Âem killed.

				LULA
		Why were you killinÂ pigeons, Mr.
		Kovich?  Were you in the extermination

				GEORGE
		No, maÂam.  I was a housepainter, 
		in the union forty-one years.  IÂm
		retired now, livinÂ with my sister, 
		Ida.  Ida moved down here twenty-five
		years ago, married an oil man named
		Smoltz, Ed Smoltz.  HeÂs dead now,

		Hell, RWW was doinÂ them a service,

		Woman drivinÂ down the street spotted

		personal property.  I used to complain
		to the city but they never lifted
		a finger.  I was gonna put out poison,
		but I was afraid somebodyÂs cat 
		would eat it.  Hell, I had six cats
		myself.  So I used the .22 because
		it didnÂt make much noise and the
		ammo was cheap.

				SAILOR
		What happened on the charges?

		Guilty on a reduced charge.  Hundred

		So who you out sleuthinÂ for now?...
		Can I help ya?

				JOHNNIE
		Actually, IÂm lookinÂ for MariettaÂs
		daughter, Lula.  Her and Âer beau
		took off the other day.  MariettaÂs
		real upset about it.

				CHET
		Hell, that rings a bell.  Someone
		told me somebody lookinÂ like her
		was at the NothinÂ Fancy yesterday.

				JOHNNIE
		Sounds right...  IÂll check it out.

				CHET
		   (checking for a gold ring
		    on JohnnieÂs hand)
		You hitched yet?

				JOHNNIE
		No sir...

				CHET
		ItÂs none of my business, but when
		are you and Marietta gonna tie the
		knot?  I always wondered why you
		never did.

				JOHNNIE
		Not for lack of love, I can tell
		ya that.

				CHET
		ThatÂs what I mean...  Always looked
		like you was just knocked out in 
		love...  Was real nice to see.

				JOHNNIE
		IÂll tell ya though, itÂs cominÂ up
		to the time when Marietta and me 
		might just set up house together and
		settle down...  I think that timeÂs

91. EXT. HOTEL BRAZIL - NEW ORLEANS - DAY

Lula waits just by the lobby door of the hotel.  In the back of the 
lobby in the shadows is an ancient, old BLACK MAN who stares at her.  
Sailor pulls the T-Bird up in front of the hotel and Lula hurries out to 
him and tosses their suitcase in the backseat.

				LULA
		LetÂs get outta here...  I suddenly
		got a funny feelinÂ about this 
		place.  FeelinÂ all that voodoo...

				SAILOR
			(winks at her)
		Gotta hex from a voodoo?

				LULA
			(smiles)
		Who do?

				SAILOR
		You do.

They laugh and take off around the corner and up past the Cafe Du Monde.

				LULA
		Oh my God...  ItÂs Johnnie...  Duck
		down!...  Get goinÂ!

 				SAILOR
		   (looking around frantically)
		Where?

				LULA
		Never mind where...  Get outta here...

Sailor pulls the car up fast and hangs a right turn.

Johnnie raises his cup of coffee to Sailor and Lula - who have long

Sailor and Lula drive.

				SAILOR
		Who knows, baby?

				LULA

		he saw us?

				SAILOR
		Lula, darlinÂ...  Makes no difference

We watch the car disappear up the street.  Slowly the camera pans and 
Reggie and Drop Shadow come walking happily along the sidewalk - 
whistling.

								CUT TO:


94. INT. THUNDERBIRD

Lula and Sailor are motoring along.

				SAILOR
		Sweetheart, keep your panties up.
		WeÂre in Jimmy Swaggart country.

Sailor and Lula both laugh.  Up ahead, Sailor spots a hitchhiker.  He 
slows to pick him up.

				LULA
		Sure you wanna do this?  Might be 
		a way they could track us.

				SAILOR
		HeÂs just a regular guyÂt needs help,
		honey.  Look at him.

The HITCHHIKER is a man about thirty with a pack on his back, and he is 
carrying a large, covered cardboard box.  He is filthy, with an uneven 
smile that exposes his jagged yellow teeth.  Lula opens the door for 
him, and after he loads his stuff, Sailor takes off down the highway.

				ROACH
		Thanks a lot.  I been standinÂ out
		there off and on for two hours, ha-ha!
		Since noon about, ha-ha!  Cops catch
		ya hitchinÂ on a Interstate around here
		they throw ya on a county road crew
		for a week, less you can pay the
		ticket, ha-ha!  Which I ainÂt got, ha-ha!

				SAILOR
		My nameÂs Sailor, and this hereÂs
		Lula.  WhatÂs yours?

				ROACH
		Marvin DeLoach.  But everÂbody calls
		me Roach, ha-ha!  Roach DeLoach, ha-ha!

				LULA
		You always make that strange little
		funny laugh when you talk?

				ROACH
		AinÂt laughinÂ, ha-ha!

				SAILOR
		What you got in the box?

				ROACH
		My dogs, ha-ha!

Roach slides the top off and tilts the box slightly toward the front.  
Inside are six small husky pups that are not more than two weeks old.

				ROACH
		IÂm headed to Alaska, ha-ha!  These
		dogs is gonna be my sled team, ha-ha!

				LULA
			(to Sailor)
		This guyÂs crazy.

				SAILOR
		Where you from, Roach?

				ROACH
		If you mean where I was born, it was
		Belzoni, MissiÂppi, ha-ha!  But I
		been brought up in Baton Rouge.

				LULA
		Why you goinÂ to Alaska?  And whereÂd
		you get them puppies?  They look sick.

Roach stares down into the box at the baby huskies and strokes each of 
them twice with a religiously unwashed hand.  The dogs whimper and lick 
his dirty fingers.

				ROACH
		I saw this movie on TV, ha-ha!  The
		Call of the Wild.  I ainÂt never
		seen snow, ha-ha!  I got these dogs
		at the pound.  Nobody wanted Âem, 
		ha-ha!  EverÂbody here got theirself
		pit bulls or some kinda hounds.  IÂm
		gonna feed these boys good so theyÂll
		be big and powerful and they can pull
		me real fast through the snow, ha-ha!

Roach pulls a piece of raw cowÂs liver out of one of his pockets of his 
field jacket and begins ripping little bits off it and feeding them to 
the dogs.

				LULA
		  (screeches as she sees this)
		Sailor!  Stop!  Stop the car now!

Sailor pulls off the road onto the shoulder of the highway and stops.  
Lula opens her door and jumps out.

				LULA
		IÂm sorry, but I canÂt take this.  
		Roach, or whatever your name is, you
		come out of there with them dogs
		this instant!

Roach sticks the liver back in his pocket and pulls his pack and the box 
of tiny canines after him.  Once he and his belongings are deposited on 
the roadside, Lula hops back in the car and slams the door.

				LULA
		IÂm truly sorry?  IÂm truly sorry, 
		Roach.  But ainÂt gonna make it to
		Alaska?  Least not any part of the 
		way with us.  YouÂd best find a 
		party to take care of those dogs 
		proper, before they all die?  And, 
		if you donÂt mind my sayinÂ so?  You
		could most certainly use some serious
		lookinÂ after yourself, startinÂ with
		a bath!

Lula takes a pair of sunglasses off the dashboard and puts them on.

				LULA
		Drive.

Sailor takes off.

				SAILOR
		You donÂt feel you was a little hard
		on the guy, honey?

				LULA
		I know youÂre thinkinÂ that I got
		moreÂn some of my mama in me?  Well,
		I couldnÂt help it.  Sailor, I really
		couldnÂt.  IÂm sorry for that guy,
		but when he pulled that drippinÂ hunk
		of awful-smellinÂ meat out of his
		pocket?  I near barfed.  And them 
		poor diseased puppies!

				SAILOR

		Just part of life on the road, peanut.

Johnnie is seated in a telephone booth at the back of the bar.

				JOHNNIE
		No, Marietta, I havenÂt found Âem.

				MARIETTA
		This is the kinda mistake can take
		a HinduÂs lifetime to unfix...  
		You better get a move on, Johnnie,

We see Reggie and Drop Shadow enter the bar.  ReggieÂs unsmiling eyes 
drift across the room until they see Johnnie in the booth.  He stares 
coldly and waits.  Drop Shadow adjusts his socks.

				JOHNNIE
		Really, Marietta, you got more 
		scenarios swimminÂ around in your
		brain than Carter got pills.  Try
		to take it easy.  Go over to Myrtle
		Beach for a few days.

				MARIETTA
		IÂm stayinÂ right here by the phone

				JOHNNIE
		I will, Marietta.  Goodbye now.

Johnnie hangs up the phone and exits the booth.  As he crosses the 
bar...

				REGGIE
			(shouting)
		Hola!  Senor Farragut!  We meet again.  

Johnnie goes over to Reggie and Drop Shadow and shakes hands.

				JOHNNIE
		I thought you two were in Austin, 
		Texas.  Or Takes-us, as they say in
		these parts.

				DROP SHADOW
		We were.  Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and
		I are on our way back to Utila, in
		the morning.

				REGGIE
		Would you like to enjoy a martini 
		with us?

				JOHNNIE
		Why not?  How was the fishinÂ?

				REGGIE
		I think they are too serious, these
		American fishermen.  In Honduras, we
		are not so concerned with the method.

Reggie orders martinis for the three of them.

				JOHNNIE
		So, itÂs back to the islands.

				DROP SHADOW
		Yes.  Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke 
		yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach
		San Pedro Sula, who is named after
		Cary Grant, and he told them there
		was a shooting.

				REGGIE
		Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local
		shrimp boat captains is in jail now.
		These people are friends of mine, so
		I must return and find out what 
		happened.

				JOHNNIE
		This island of yours sounds like a 
		kind of unpredictable place.  

				REGGIE
			(laughs)
		It has its moments of uncertainty.

				DROP SHADOW
		But how are you finding New Orleans,
		Senor Farragut?

				JOHNNIE
		Call me Johnnie...  N.O. has always
		been a good town to sit around in.


				REGGIE
		I can tell you are an intelligent
		man, Johnnie.  One difference between
		your country and mine is that in the
		islands, it does not pay to reveal
		oneÂs intelligence...  Others may use
		what they perceive against us...

Reggie raises his glass to JohnnieÂs.

				REGGIE
		Hasta siempre.

				JOHNNIE
		Hasta siempre.

				REGGIE
		Do you know how it came about that
		copper wire was invented in Scotland?

				JOHNNIE
		HowÂs that?

				DROP SHADOW
		Two Scotsmen were fighting over a 
		penny.

Johnnie finishes off his martini.

				JOHNNIE
		I gotta admit, you guys are
			(sliding off the stool)
		two in four dozen.

				REGGIE
		The real joke is we never went fishing,

Johnnie squints his eyes thinking about this one.  Reggie and Drop 
Shadow smile and stand to leave.

Sailor spots a Red Devil gas station that still has its lights on and

		How about speed metal?

The kids look worried and take a step back.

		Any kinda rockÂnÂroll, honey.

				BILLY
		ThereÂs a boogie joint just about a

99. INT. CLUB ZANZIBAR - NIGHT

When they walk in, the BAND is playing a slow blues and THREE OR FOUR 
COUPLES are swaying on the dance floor.  There are a dozen tables and a 
long bar in the room which is done up in a strange dark azquatic motif.  
Eight of the tables are occupied and SIX OR SEVEN MEN stand at the bar.  
Everyone in the place is black except for one WHITE WOMAN who is sitting 
alone at a table smoking a cigarette and drinking Pearl straight from 
the bottle.  The atmosphere is not friendly, but Lula takes Sailor by 
the arm.

				LULA
		Come on.

They step up to the bar and order two Lone Star beers.  The BARTENDER, a 
tall, heavyset man slowly forms his hand into Âthe bird.Â  He holds his 
hand that way while he speaks...

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
		This is a friendly place, son.  You 
		folks just relax and have a nice time.

				LULA
		   (bound and determined not 
		    to be intimidated)
		You got yourself a deal.

				BARTENDER
			(to Sailor)
		ThatÂs a real jacket...  By that,
		I mean a real stupid jacket.

				SAILOR
		This is a snakeskin jacket, and for
		me it represents a symbol of my 
		individuality and my belief in
		personal freedom.

				BARTENDER
		FuckinÂ honky cracker mumbo jumbo.


The bartender moves on down the bar.  Lula and Sailor take a small table 
near the door.

				LULA
		IÂll be damned if IÂm leavinÂ.  That
		band is too good?

				SAILOR
		Uh huh.

				LULA
		You notice that woman when we come
		in?  The white woman sittinÂ by 
		herself?

				SAILOR
		Yeah.

				LULA
		Well, she ainÂt talked to nobody 
		and ainÂt nobody spoke to her that
		I could tell.  What you make of that?

				SAILOR
		Honey, we beinÂ strangers here and 
		all, this is the kinda place we donÂt
		want to make nothinÂ of nothinÂ.

				LULA
		You think sheÂs pretty?

Sailor looks at the woman.  She lights a new cigarette off a butt, then 
squashes the butt in the ashtray.  She is thirty years old, maybe more.  
Shoulder-length, bleached blonde hair, black at the roots.  Clear skin, 
green eyes.  Long, straight nose with a small bump on it.  She is 
wearing a low-cut lavender dress that would have emphasized her breasts 
had she not been so flat-chested.  Slender.

				SAILOR
		I tend to like Âem with a little 
		more meat on the bones.  Face ainÂt
		bad, though.

Lula gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle.

				SAILOR
		WhatÂs wrong, sweetheart?  SomethinÂ
		botherinÂ you?

				LULA
		Mama.  I been thinkinÂ about her.
		SheÂs probÂly worried to death by now.

				SAILOR
		MoreÂn likely.

				LULA
		I want to call her and tell her
		IÂm okay.  That weÂre okay.

				SAILOR
		I ainÂt so sure itÂs a great idea,
		but thatÂs up to you.  Just donÂt tell

		Pardon me?  YÂall got a phone here

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
		CanÂt you read?

Sailor finds her sitting on the ground, leaning against the passenger

Upstairs in a private dining room, Mr. Reindeer is dining with TWELVE 
GUESTS in formal evening attire.  Behind him, a JAZZ TRIO and a 
STRIPTEASE ARTIST are hard at work.  Mr. Reindeer smiles and leans over 
very close to a beautiful WOMAN sitting to his left.

				MR. REINDEER
		Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet, 
		eating her curds and whey...  Along
		came a spider and sat down beside her,
		and extended his hand out to play.

With this, he reaches under the table between her legs.  She turns red 
and Mr. Reindeer laughs and lights a cigarette.

				MR. REINDEER
		Oh dear...  Another Miss Dull Cunt.

Reggie and Drop Shadow enter through a door on the other side of the 
room.  Reggie catches Mr. ReindeerÂs eye and smiles.  Reggie reaches in 
his pocket and takes out a silver dollar - flips it in the air - catches 
it - and puts it back in his pocket.  Mr. Reindeer smiles and waves him 
over to the table.  He whispers something in ReggieÂs ear - then gives 
him an envelope.

				MR. REINDEER
		When I gave you the silver dollar I
		forgot to give you the contents of
		this envelope.  They are to be 
		returned.  Show it just before the deed...

Reggie pockets the envelope - joins Drop Shadow - and as they are 
leaving the dining room, they join a woman, JUANA, who looks half-
Oriental, half-Cajun.  She wears a strange, short, yellowish-bleached 
blonde wig.

				MARIETTA
		What is it, Johnnie?

		Just some guys I met here...  I

Marietta continues to stare at Reggie, Drop Shadow, and Juana before

The front desk clerk steps from behind his desk and hurries into the 
lobby.

				DESK CLERK
		IÂm sorry...  But I have overlooked

He hands Marietta a note inside an envelope which she opens and reads 
immediately.  We see the note.  

NOTE
Gone fishing with a friend - maybe
buffalo hunting.  Johnnie.


				MARIETTA
		Oh God!  What does that mean?

		IÂm sure I wouldnÂt know, maÂam ...

The front door of the hotel opens and in walks Santos.  He seems to know 
exactly where Marietta is and steps to the door of the sitting room off 
the lobby.  He stands in the doorway and smiles at Marietta.

		Santos...  WhereÂs J-J-Johnnie?

				SANTOS
		Shhhhhh...

119. INT. SMALL HUT - DESERTED BAYOU - NIGHT

Johnnie is tied to a small wooden straight-backed chair.  His mouth is 
gagged and taped shut.  His hair is caked with dry blood and one fresh 
tickle curls down his forehead to his eyes which are just now beginning 
to open and focus.  Juana is finishing tying his left ankle to the chair 
leg.  Johnnie moans and Juana brings her big, smiling face up in front 
of his.

				JUANA
		Johnnie, you take a good look at me,
		baby, cause you gonna hafÂta watch

Juana steps two paces across the hut where two dirty old soda bottles 
sit - one in one corner perched on a dried tree trunk - the other in the 
opposite corner perched on an old fence post.  Juana touches the left 
bottle (#1) once, and crosses and touches the right bottle (#2) once and 
comes back and touches JohnnieÂs face.

				JUANA
		You see, Johnnie.  I toucha number
		one bottle once, I toucha number two
		bottle once, and I touch your face.
		This is a game we love to play.  I

Reggie and Drop Shadow step out of the darkness behind Johnnie and come 
around to face him.

				REGGIE
		Hey, Johnnie...  Reggie - you remember
		Reggie, donÂt ya?  Look what I caught.
			(to Juana)
		IÂm gettinÂ hot too, mama.

Reggie and Juana kiss hot in front of Johnnie.  Juana puts her face down 
in front of JohnnieÂs again.

Reggie reaches his hand around in front of Johnnie - showing him a .45 
Automatic.

				DROP SHADOW
		ThatÂs a Marine issue.  It goes off
		somethinÂ terrible - you wanna see?

Drop Shadow pulls the hammer back which makes a loud Âclick.Â

				JUANA
		You hear click?

Johnnie jumps as Drop Shadow blows a big hole in the far wall in front 
of Johnnie.

				REGGIE

		Hell, itÂs even worse than I

Reggie comes out in front of Johnnie - Juana grabs him.  They kiss hot 
again.

face.

Reggie reaches his hand around JohnnieÂs face - tears off tape and gag - 
then opens his hand and shows Johnnie a cufflink with a particular 
design in turquoise, orange, and silver.

				REGGIE
		I forgot to show you this.  The

As her finger touches JohnnieÂs face there is a loud ÂCLICK.Â  Johnnie

The livingroom is on fire and Lula throws open the door to her motherÂs

Sailor starts to slow down.  The highway is suddenly littered with 
clothes strewn everywhere and two open suitcases smashed near the side 
of the road.  Sailor slows down to a crawl.  He and Lula turn to each

overturned car.

				LULA
		Oh God, Sailor.

Sailor reaches out cautiously and takes hold of the girlÂs arm.

				GIRL
		OWWW GOD!!!  LEAVE ME ALONE...

She keeps digging her fingers into a bloody wound in her head.

				GIRL
		Gotta find my wallet.

		DonÂt you say one word of this to

The girls falls to one knee and struggles to get back up.  Sailor and 
Lula each take an arm and try to help her.

				GIRL
		WHEREÂS MY HAIRBRUSH?...

Sailor and Lula help the girl stand, but her eyes start rolling back and 
a bunch of fresh blood comes gushing up out of her mouth.

				LULA
		I canÂt take this, Sailor.  SheÂs
		dyinÂ right in front of our eyes...

				SAILOR
		IÂm afraid she is, baby.

Sailor kneels down next to the girl and runs his hand gently across her 
forehead.

				GIRL

		Get my lipstick...
			(whisper)
		ItÂs in my purse.

The girl dies.  Sailor and Lula hold real still for a moment.  Lula 
starts to cry.

				LULA
		She died right in front of me.  WhyÂd
		she have to go and do that, Sailor?

				SAILOR
		LetÂs get outta here, honey.

Before getting up, Sailor lets his hand come off the girlÂs forehead 
down over her eyes - closing them.  He puts his hand on her cheek then 
gets up.  He puts his arm around Lula and they go back to her car.  
Sailor helps Lula in on her side and closes the door for her.  He goes 
around, gets in and looks over at Lula, who breaks down crying harder.  
Sailor starts the car and takes off.

She strips off the spread, tosses it in a corner and sits down on the 
bed.

				LULA
		And no AC.

				SAILOR
		Fan works.

				LULA
		Now what?

				SAILOR
		LetÂs get a sandwich and find out
		about some work.

				LULA
		Sailor?

				SAILOR
		Yeah?

				LULA
		This ainÂt exactly my most thrillinÂ
		notion of startinÂ a new life.

They stare at each other.  Lula suddenly feels sick to her stomach and 
slumps down on the edge of the bed.

				LULA
		IÂm gonna stay here in this room, 
		Sailor.  I donÂt feel so good?  This
		heat makes me tired.

				SAILOR
		Okay, honey, IÂll see you later.

125. EXT. REDÂS GARAGE - DAY

A tall, skinny man, RED, in his early thirties with wild, uncombed hair 
the color of pomegranate, walks out of the garage.

				SAILOR
		You Red?

				RED
			(with a smile)
		Well, I ainÂt Blackie.

Sailor holds out his right hand to shake.

				SAILOR
		NameÂs Sailor Ripley.  Katy over at
		the drugstore thought you might have
		some work I could do.

Red extends his oil-blackened right hand and shakes.

				RED
		Things ainÂt real hot right now.
		Rex, there though,
			(nodding toward a half-naked
			man burrowed under an Â83 Buick)
		is about to relocate in about a week
		to San Angelo.  I might could use a
		man when he does...  You good with
		engines?

				SAILOR
		I ainÂt no Enzo Ferrari, but they 
		used to call me Wrench when I was a
		kid.

				RED
		WeÂll see how she goes then when
		Rex takes off.  Check back.

Two men, SPARKY and BUDDY, both about forty, walk up to Red.  One of 
them wears a grey baseball cap with a Confederate flag on it and the 
other has an LBJ straw Stetson.

				SPARKY
		HowÂs it look?

				RED
		Reckon the headÂs cracked, like I
		thought.

				SPARKY
		Shit, thatÂs what I was afraid of.

				RED
		IÂll get you foreigners a beer.



				BUDDY
			(to Sailor)
		IÂm Buddy, and this hereÂs Sparky.

Sailor introduces himself to Sparky and Buddy and Rex.  They all shake 
hands or nod and move out of the sun to drink their beers.

				SAILOR
		My girl and I are lookinÂ for a 
		place to settle.  WeÂre bunked down
		at the Iguana Motel.

				SPARKY
		So are we.  ItÂs the only motel in 
		Big Tuna.  Have you met Bobby ÂJust
		Like The CountryÂ Peru yet?

				SAILOR
		No, we just got in a hour and a 
		half ago.

				BUDDY
		You will.  HeÂs the Mr. Fix-It at 
		the Iguana.  His truck broke down 
		here a couple of months ago.

				REX
		Escaped con.  Man got some serious
		prison tattoos.

				RED
		EverÂbody got a past.

				BUDDY
		Just some got more future in Âem
		than others.

				REX
		That ainÂt no lie.

Sailor finishes his beer, stands it on the ground and steps on it, 
crushing it flat.

				SAILOR
		Been nice meetinÂ yÂall.  ÂPreciate
		the beer.  IÂll be seeinÂ yÂall

				BUDDY
		Very soon.

				SPARKY

127. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

In front of the door there is a large, damp spot on the rug where about 
a hundred and fifty flies are buzzing and landing.  Sailor sees this 
when he opens the door.  He steps across the large spot and finds Lula 
just waking up on the bed.

				LULA
		That you, Sail, honey?

				SAILOR
		The only one.

Lula opens her eyes and looks at him.

				LULA
		You find any work?

				SAILOR
		Maybe.  Met a guy named Red, owns a
		garage, could have some work in
		about a week.  Met a few hard luck
		boys whoÂs stayinÂ here.  WhatÂs

				LULA
		I barfed.  Tried to make it to the

				SAILOR
		You sick?

				LULA
		A little, I think...  DarlinÂ?

				SAILOR
		Yeah?

Sailor goes over and sits on the bed.

				LULA
		I donÂt know that this is the right

Sailor strokes LulaÂs head.

129. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Sailor, Lula, Sparky, and Buddy are sitting in the courtyard of the 
motel sharing SparkyÂs fifth of Ezra Brooks.  An electric bug killer is 
working overtime.  Buddy is reading from a newspaper.

				BUDDY
		     (reading from paper)
		ÂRobert Brenton, twenty-five, was

Sailor looks at Lula.

				SAILOR
		Susan Day...

The assistant manager, TOMMY THOMPSON, speaks from the shadows behind 
the group.

				TOMMY
		Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck.  That
		stupid shit...  That fuckinÂ Bob was
		so fuckinÂ dumb...  He deserved to
		die...  That asshole.

They all look over at Tommy.

				BUDDY
		Hey, Tommy...  WhatÂs goinÂ on over
		there in number four where al them 
		bright lights are all the time?

				TOMMY
		Them are makinÂ a pornographic movie...
		Texas style...  Why?  You wanna join in?

				SPARKY
		How do you get sixteen Haitians into
		a Dixie Cup?

				LULA
		How?

				SPARKY
		Tell Âem it floats.

				BUDDY
		SparkyÂs big on Florida jokes.

				SPARKY
		You need a active sense of humor to
		survive in the Big Tuna.

BOBBY PERU walks in and comes over.

				BOBBY
		Hey, everybody.

				BUDDY
		Sailor, Lula, this hereÂs the man 
		himself.  Bobby, this is Sailor
		and Lula, the most recent strandees,
		economic variety.

Bobby nods to Lula and offers a hand to Sailor.

				BOBBY
		Bobby Peru, just like the country.

Sparky and Buddy laugh.

				BUDDY
		AccordinÂ to Red and Rex, BobbyÂs
		the most excitinÂ item to hit Big
		Tuna since the Â86 cyclone sheared
		the roof off the high school.

				SPARKY
		Only in town two months and there 
		ainÂt a young thing around donÂt 
		know how that cobra tattoo works, 
		right, Bob?

Bobby laughs.  He has a lopsided grin that exposes only three brownish 
front teeth and he has flat black eyes that seem to reflect no light.

				LULA
		You from Texas, Mr. Peru?

Bobby pulls up a chair and pours himself a shotglass full of whiskey.

				BOBBY
		IÂm from all over.

				SAILOR
		    (noticing a USMC tattoo
		     on BobbyÂs right hand)
		You was in the Marines, huh?

Bobby looks down at his hand, flexs it.

				BOBBY
		Four years.

				SPARKY
		Bobby was at Cao Ben.

				LULA
		WhatÂs Cao Ben?

				BOBBY
			(to Lula)
		How old are you?

				LULA
		Twenty.

				BUDDY
		Lotta women and kids and old people
		died at Cao Ben.

				BOBBY
		March, 1968.  We torched a village
		and the government made a big deal
		out of it.

Bobby sips the whiskey and closes his eyes for several seconds before 
reopening them and looking at Buddy.  His eyes open slowly and they 
practically burn a hole in Buddy.

				BOBBY
			(to Buddy)
		You was on a ship, pardner.  Hard to
		make contact with the people when
		youÂre off floatinÂ in the Gulf of
		Tonkin.

				SPARKY
		    (changing the subject)
		Hey Bobby, have yourself another 
		glass Âa Jack.

Sparky refills BobbyÂs shotglass.  Bobby tosses it back in one gulp.

				BOBBY
		DonÂt mind if I fuckinÂ do...  
		SpeakinÂ Âa Jack...  One-eyed Jacks
		yearninÂ to go a peepinÂ in a
		seafood store...  Good meetinÂ you.
		Adios, boys.

He walks out and after heÂs gone...

				LULA
		SomethinÂ in that man scares me.

				BUDDY
		No shit.


				SPARKY
		  (pouring himself another shot)
		BobbyÂs got a way...  CanÂt shake
		that institution odor.

Lula puts a hand on SailorÂs leg.

				LULA
		DarlinÂ, I still ainÂt feelinÂ so

Lula goes right to the bed and flops down on it.

				SAILOR
		Anything I can do for you?

				LULA
		No, I donÂt think so, Sail.  I
		just need to lie down.

Lula listens to Sailor brush his teeth, urinate into the toilet and 
flush it.  Sailor comes out of the bathroom and climbs into bed.

				LULA
		Sailor?  You know what?

				SAILOR
		I know you ainÂt particularly pleased
		beinÂ here.

				LULA
		Not that.  Look at what I wrote down

Lula hands Sailor a note which reads ÂIÂm pregnant.Â  Sailor looks into 
her eyes.

				SAILOR
		ItÂs okay by me, peanut.

				LULA
		Well, nothinÂ personal, but I ainÂt

Sailor crumples the note and puts it in the ashtray.

				LULA
		Was a massacre.  Soldiers there

				SAILOR
		Lula, he mighta did, I donÂt know.
		But it donÂt matter now.  Lotta guys
		go outta control in a war and it

Lula puffs hard on her cigarette.

				LULA
		I sure enjoy smokinÂ, Sailor.  I 
		hate that itÂs bad for you.

Sailor turns on his side, away from Lula, and pulls a pillow over his 
head.

				LULA
		That manÂs a black angel, Sailor.
		You hook up with him, youÂll regret
		it.  If you live to.

S				AILOR
		Thanks, darlinÂ, I know you got my

		Âpreciate it sincerely.  I love

Lula lights a second More off the first one and stubs out the butt on 
the dresser top.  

				LULA
		This whole worlds wild at heart and
		weird on top.

Lula turns over, away from Sailor.

				LULA
			(softly)
		I wish you really, truly loved me...
		I wish youÂd sing me ÂLove Me TenderÂ

138. INT. BAY ST. CLEMENT HOTEL - STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Sailor and Lula are walking down the carpeted stairs when Sailor is 
called by BOB RAY LEMON, who is coming down towards them fast.  Marietta 
stands at the top - watching.

				BOB RAY
		Hey Sailor...  Wait a minute...  I
		got somethinÂ for ya.

As Bob Ray passes Lula on the stairs - he puts his hand between her 
legs.  Sailor starts to see red.  Bob Ray smiles and steps down to 
Sailor.  He leans in and whispers in SailorÂs ear.

				BOB RAY
		Shit, man...  Marietta says you been 
		tryinÂ to fuck her in the toilets 
		for the past ten minutes...  You
		crazy fuckinÂ bad boy tryinÂ to 
		fuck your girlÂs mama...  How do
		you think that cute little cunt Lula

		look at this...
			(shows Sailor one thousand
			dollars in cash)
		Marietta just gave me this to kill
		you right now, and afterward she
		said Lula was mine to fuck all the
		way into next Sunday.

Bob Ray pulls a knife, but SailorÂs fist is already halfway through Bob 
RayÂs brain.  From there, Sailor steps firmly into the crazy zone.  
Amidst blood-curdling hysterical screams from a growing throng of 
SOUTHERN BELLES, Sailor starts taking Bob Ray apart limb by limb and 
doesnÂt stop until Bob Ray lays completely destroyed and completely dead 
at the foot of the stairs.  The crowd of formally dressed onlookers 
stand aghast.  Sailor stares up at Marietta.  Both their eyes burning 
with hate.

Bobby lets the screen door bang shut behind him as he comes in and roams 
around the livingroom.

		Nice of you to drop by.

				BOBBY
		Told ya I would.  You still riled?

				PERDITA

		You still screwing sixteen-year-olds

Bobby keeps circling.

				PERDITA
		Wish IÂd fuckinÂ cut you up good.

				BOBBY
		You heard from Reggie?

				PERDITA
		Juana called.  TheyÂre stayinÂ

Bobby stops walking and stares at the photograph on the wall.

				BOBBY
		StayinÂ a few extra days in the big
		N.O., huh?  This you?

Perdita turns her head and looks, then turns back.

				PERDITA
		Yes.

We see the photo now.  In it are Perdita along with her sister, Juana, 
and her husband, Reggie, whom we recognize as the killers of Johnnie.

				BOBBY
		DonÂt look like you.

Bobby turns around and leans down and puts his face next to PerditaÂs 
from behind.


				BOBBY
		The cobraÂs waitinÂ to strike, chica.

				PERDITA
		That guy Sailor came around this

				BOBBY
			(laughs out loud)
		No shit?!?!  You know him?

				PERDITA
		Used to.

				BOBBY
		WhatÂd you say?

				PERDITA
		No, of course.

Bobby takes out a silver dollar and flips it into the air.  It lands 
tails up in his hand.  He pockets it.

				BOBBY
		ThatÂs right...  Could have a bad
		accident, though ... before ... 
		durinÂ ... or after a hold-up...

				PERDITA
		WhatÂs gonna happen when he sees me 
		drivinÂ the car tomorrow?

				BOBBY
		Maybe heÂll get a little nervous,
		but who gives a shit?

Bobby lowers his hands into the front of PerditaÂs blouse and cups her 
breasts.  She burns the back of his left wrist with her cigarette.  
Bobby jumps back, then grabs PerditaÂs hair and pulls her over the couch 
onto the floor.  Neither of them speak.  She tries to stand, but Bobby 
keeps his right foot on her chest while he blows the back of his wounded 
wrist.  Perdita shoves his leg to one side and rolls away.  She stand up 
and spits at him.

				BOBBY

141. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

Lula lays very still on the bed.  Her head is close to the small 
turquoise radio on the bedside table.  She is listening to a piece of 
sad, nostalgic music and as we move in closer to her and the radio - the 
volume increases.

Lula remembers some ÂmomentsÂ in her life with Sailor: (Music continues 
over)

When he kissed her outside the jail gate.

When he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail.

When they sat behind the Confederate Soldier.

When they danced to ÂSlaughter House.Â

Suddenly, Lula sees an image in her mind that she does not recognize.  
She sees an abstract image of reflected light with two eyes looking 
through it at her.  The image puzzles her.

(The Music continues over)

Sailor rips open the package and pulls a nylon leg over his head, 
stretching the calf part to fit.

Perdita pulls up in front of the store.  The street is deserted.

is by the front door holding his pistol on the two old guys.  When Bobby 
finishes tying the money bag - he lifts the shotgun and blows a hole 
through the chest of one of the old men.  Sailor goes into shock.

Sailor turns his pistol on Bobby now.  Bobby spins his shotgun around 
and points it at Sailor.

				BOBBY
		YouÂre next, fucker.

The second old man is reaching under the counter.

Sailor fires his .32 at Bobby.  There are no live bullets in his pistol.  
It just makes a dry click.  Bobby smiles and is just about to kill 
Sailor when out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of the second 
old man bringing out a big shotgun of his own.  Bobby instinctively 
spins and empties the second barrel of his two-barrel shotgun into the 
old gentleman.  As Bobby is reloading fast, Sailor sprints through the 
front door.  Bobby is right behind him as he flys out the front door.


148A. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

The deputy recovers and comes up on one knee with his revolver clasped 
in both hands.  He fires his first shot into BobbyÂs thigh and his 
second into BobbyÂs left hip.  The shock of the initial slug causes 
Bobby to drop the bag.  The impact of the second forces BobbyÂs right 
hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under 
his chin.  The Ithaca goes off, blowing Bobby backwards through the 
RAMOS on the plate glass window of the feed store.

Sailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls.  He puts his hand 
over his hosieried head and keeps his face in the dirt until the deputy 
orders him to stand up.

Tears are pouring down MariettaÂs cheeks.  She holds Lula to her and 
Lula does not resist.  Lula just stares at Santos.

pale.

		Oh, yes, you can.

Santos steps forward.  Lula begins to tremble.

				SANTOS
		Your mamaÂs been real worried Âbout

SantosÂ arms begin to go around Lula.  Lula lets out a blood-curdling

bear hug.  On one shirt cuff we see a cufflink which is turquoise, 
orange, and silver.

Dearest Sailor Darling,

The first thing youÂll want to know is IÂm keeping the baby.
Mama wasnÂt for it in the beginning but I think sheÂs looking
forward to it.  IÂm gonna name it Pace no matter if itÂs a 
boy or a girl.  Pace Ripley sounds good, donÂt it?  ItÂs
kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old 
when you get out.

I feel like IÂm kind of in prison too, but I know in six
months, itÂll be over and IÂll have a son or daughter to
show for it.  Our child!!

I love you Sailor.  I donÂt know how much or what it 
means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know
youÂre thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss
you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever
called me that.

Mama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My
daddy left a lot of money somehow and theyÂre spending
it like there is no tomorrow.  IÂm going to move out as
soon as I can.

Mama and Santos said because of the baby theyÂre lookinÂ
at the two of us in a different light - whatever that
means.

Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows
where.  I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you.

Time donÂt really fly honey does it?

Love,
your Lula

P.S. I miss dancing...

Dear Lula,

It is fine with me about the baby as you already know. 
And Pace being your family name and all is just right.
What about a middle name if it is a boy after my 
granddaddy Roscoe?  He would be proud I know though
he is long passed.  Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound
so bad do you think?

This place is not so pretty as Pee Dee.  Not pretty
at all.  There are boys inside these walls meaner
than Peru you can bet.  There is a Death House.  I
am getting along.  The only thing is not thinking
about the future.

I miss dancing with you, too.  I love you.  It is
hard to end this letter.  If I stop writing youÂre
gone.  There is not a lot more to say though.
Vava con dios mi amor.

Sailor

Lula makes a wide left turn onto Jeff Davis Highway without signaling, 
causing the driver of a white Bonneville headed across the intersection 
to jam on his brakes in order to avoid a collision.  The Bonneville 
driver sits on his horn and shouts at Lula.

				PACE
		Mama, you almost crashed us.

Lula steadies the steering wheel of her Camaro with her left elbow while 
she strikes a match and lights up a More.  She throws the match out the 
window and takes possession of the wheel with both hands, the cigarette 
is clamped in her teeth.

ThatÂs all it takes.  The gang is on him.  Sailor tries to defend

In the sky above Sailor, a large glowing bubble holding the beautiful 
Good Witch of the North comes floating down above him.

SailorÂs eyes suddenly see the Good Witch through his closed eyelids.  
His mouth speaks through closed lips.

jumps on the hood of LulaÂs car.

She sees him.

Lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms.  Behind them is a

It is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in Big Tuna, 
but now she knows what it is.  It is PaceÂs happy, smiling eyes looking 
up at the two of them in love.

Sailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into LulaÂs eyes and sings ÂLove 
Me Tender.Â 

The people in their cars, and the people on the street look on with a 
feeling of love and happiness in their hearts.
