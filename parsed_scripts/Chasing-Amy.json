I can't stand next to you without wanting to hold you.  I can't look into your eyes without feeling that longing you only read about in trashy romance novels. I can't talk to you without wanting to express my love for everything you are.  I know this will probably queer our friendship - no pun intended - but I had to say it, because I've never felt this before, and I like who I am because of it.

We've been everything to each other but intimates.  And now, we'll have been through that together too.  And it won't have to be a total leap for you, because a woman will be involved.  And when it's over, all that aggression you feel toward Alyssa will be gone. Because you'll have shared in something beautiful with the woman I love.  It'll be cathartic.  A true communion.

Just hanging around her house after school, 'cuz her parents were like never home, and shit.  And one day, Rick just whips it out, and starts rubbing it on her leg and shit; chasing her around the living room - I was dying.  But you know what the crazy bitch did? She fucking drops to her knees, and just starts sucking him off right in front of me!  Like I wasn't even there man!  I almost died!  But that's not the fucked up part - the fucked up part was Rick, man - right in the middle of it, he turns to me and he's pointing at her and he says \"Cohee.\" Just like that - \"Cohee.\"  So I'm like I'll give it a shot.  And I start pulling her pants down all slow, 'cuz I figure any second she's gonna turn around and belt me in the mouth, right?  But yo, check this shit out - she's all into it man!  She don't try to stop me or nothing!  She's all wet and shit, and I just went to work, know what I'm saying?  Me and Rick are going to town on this crazy bitch, and she's just loving it, all moaning and shit!  It was fucked up! So Rick's the one that came up with the nickname - 'cuz that day, she had us locked in tight from both sides - like a pair of goddamn Chinese finger cuffs!",
