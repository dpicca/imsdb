He rubs his hand over his sweating face, raises his eyes to the ceiling as if he were swearing. Then he surrenders, accepts the condition. SALVATORE is serious, does not flaunt his victory, but you can tell he is happy. He takes out a sheet of paper he had already prepared, with the solution to the problem, rolls it up into a tiny ball and as soon as the TEACHER passes by, takes aim and flicks it to him.

He sees ALFREDO through the lion's mouth. ALFREDO also catches sight of him. SALVATORE gives him a timid wave of the hand, as if asking if he can come up a moment. The look on ALFREDO'S face is unmistakable, irrevocable: N0! SALVATORE'S not surprised; after what happened it won't be easy to win him over. Yet there must be some way. But what is it? As usual, SALVATORE is smart as the devil when he's out to get something. Through the emergency exit he sees a woman pass by with a packet in her hand. It is ALFREDO's WIFE, and the packet is his supper. SALVATORE leaps to his feet and runs out to her.",
