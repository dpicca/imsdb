It is the true... digitalization of real life. You don't just go to a party anymore, you go to a party with your digital camera and your friends relive the party on Facebook. And tagging. The idea that you could tag anyone you wanted in those pictures so that people could find themselves. Then a digital log of every change in a person's life, broadcast to all their friends instantaneously.",
