He pauses close to one horse's head. Rocklin sees Dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances around, and raise it to drink. The bottle is almost to Dave's lips when the horse shies, swinging its head. The bottle is knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground. Now Rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds amusing despite its seriousness.
