Because we are on prime time, I am going to discard my customary remarks in favor of a few personal reflections.   When I was principal at Clifton High and these two were students, I had very little faith that Rupert here would amount to very much. But like his teachers and his fellow students, I underestimated this fine young man.   Some say that this misjudgment is directly tied to my recent dismissal as head of the Clifton School System.
