Probably without life as we conceive it, but capable of performing functional activities on an astronomic scale.  My view is that Solaris has reached, in a single bound, the \"homeostatic ocean\" stage without passing through stages of terrestrial evolution.  I think it bypassed cellular development altogether. It hasn't taken endless eons to adapt itself to its environment, but in fact dominated its environment immediately.  From the moment it existed, it was the most superior element in the Universe.",
