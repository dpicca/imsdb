If we could raise the temperature of the planet by only four degrees, the resultant melting of the ice caps would increase the density of the atmosphere, thus holding greater heat, melting the icecaps further.  We could use the greenhouse effect to our benefit.  To do this, we needed to increase the oxygen content of the atmosphere.  Resultingly, a series of probes were sent, each releasing further and further genetically manipulated lichen and algaes designed to stand the rigors of the Martian environment while augmenting the oxygen content of the Martian atmosphere.  In the last 28 years, we have sent 2200 probes.  The terraforming was initially successful.",
