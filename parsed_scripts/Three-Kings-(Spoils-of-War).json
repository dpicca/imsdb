They fire on Epps and Jaeger, the bullets pinging off the rocks all around them.  Epps and Jaeger are little more than passengers on their horses as they run wild like stampeding mustangs.  And good for it, too, otherwise they might be dead by now.  They break for a trail that leads further up the mountain, but it does little to shake loose their pursuers.

The GUNNER lets fly a barrage of shells that literally tear up the ground where our boys were just standing.  We see what the chopter's weapons will do to rock.  We can imagine what they would do to flesh.  Epps, Jaeger and Wes take cover behind some rocks.  The gunship swings around, picks up speed and bears down on them.  More shells fired.  They punch into and through the rocks our boys use for cover.  Again the three scatter, and just in time as the shells rip their way through the rock.",

Like something out of an old John Ford western dozens of mounted Arabs suddenly appear over a dune.  They ride fast and hard for Epps and Jaeger like Apaches heading for a wagon train.  They easily overtake our two, momentarily swallowing them amongst the thundering hoofs, and ride on a bit as if playing with them.  Epps and Jaeger stop, then bolt in the other direction.  The Arabs ride back, again past Epps and Jaeger swiping them to the ground; the horses kicking up a spray of lose sand over them.  It looks like a cattle round up, and our two are the cattle.  Epps and Jaeger get up to make another run of it, and again the Arabs bear down on them.  This time they mean business.",
