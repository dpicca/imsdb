You see, she was raised at a time when they still had the \"obey\" part in the wedding vows.  He was always jealous. She couldn't talk to another man without him thinking she wanted to go to bed with him.  He never hit me. But the things he did to her...and she would always just take it.  She never fought back.  He'd get drunk and...she'd tell people she just fell down or something.  Then one night...I was thirteen.  Something happened.  My mom suddenly wouldn't take it anymore.  Something made her say enough is enough.  She hit back.  Tat only made it worse.  I watched as he hit her over and over.  Then he knocked her down the stairs.  She broke her neck. And when y father saw what he'd done - he finally became human.  He cried over her body for a while, then went into the garage and blew his brains out with a shotgun.  To this day I don't remember what that final straw was.  The shrinks say I've blocked it out of my memory. There's no one else alive who knows what really happened.  I have dreams about it sometimes, but there's always that blank spot.  A missing piece.",
